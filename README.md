# DiscountCards

The command java __*edu/shapkofil/Main*__ in __*/out/production/DiscountCards*__ directory will run the programme.
Starting the programme ask the user for a the his/her name and then takes him/her to the main menu in it’s TUI. The user has 4 options to choose from: 
* __Change card__
Allowes the user to choose one of the three cards. The cards store the discount calculation method and owners name.
* __Enter purchase data__
Lets the user type in the turnover for the lat mouth and the current purchase cost
* __Get purchase details__
Outputs the wanted information about the discount rate, the discount and the total cost of the purchase.
* __Exit__ (self-explanatory) 

For the actual build I’ve provided an architecture uml diagram both in here (the repo’s markdown file) and the main directory of this piece of software.
